Transactions
------------

Transaction support in SQLObject is left to the database.
Transactions can be used like:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/transactions1.html

The ``trans`` object here is essentially a wrapper around a single
database connection, and `commit` and `rollback` just pass that
message to the `psycopg` connection.

If you want to use transactions you should also turn `_cacheValues`
off, like:

.. raw:: html
   :file: ../examples/snippets/transactions2.html

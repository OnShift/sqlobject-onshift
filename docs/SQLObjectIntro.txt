Introduction
============

SQLObject is an *object-relational mapper*.  It allows you to
translate RDBMS table rows into Python objects, and manipulate those
objects to transparently manipulate the database.

In using SQLObject, you will create a class definition that will
describe how the object translates to the database table.  SQLObject
will produce the code to access the database, and update the database
with your changes.  The generated interface looks similar to any other
interface, and callers need not be aware of the database backend.

SQLObject also includes a novel feature to avoid generating,
textually, your SQL queries.  This also allows non-SQL databases to be
used with the same query syntax.

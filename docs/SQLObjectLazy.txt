Lazy Updates
------------

By default SQLObject sends an ``UPDATE`` to the database for every
attribute you set, or everytime you call ``.set()``.  If you want to
avoid this many updates, add ``_lazyUpdate = True`` to your class
definition.  Then updates will only be written to the database when
you call ``inst.syncUpdate()`` or ``obj.sync()``: ``.sync()`` also
refetches the data from the database, which ``.syncUpdate()`` does not
do.

When enabled instances will have a property ``dirty``, which indicates
if there are pending updates.  Inserts are still done immediately.
